        <p>Brigadeiros are a popular Brazilian sweet treat made with condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles. Here's a basic recipe:</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder (or chocolate)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter (plus extra for greasing)</li>
            <li>Chocolate sprinkles (for coating, but it's optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter.</li>
            <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and stir the mixture continuously.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring until the mixture thickens and starts to come away from the sides of the pan. This can take around 10-15 minutes. The mixture should have a fudgy consistency.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and let the mixture cool down to room temperature.</li>
            <li>While the mixture is cooling, lightly butter your hands to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Once the mixture has cooled, take small portions and roll them into small balls, approximately 1 inch in diameter.</li>
            <li>Roll each brigadeiro ball in chocolate sprinkles until fully coated.</li>
            <li>Place the brigadeiros on a greased plate or tray.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until you have used all the mixture.</li>
            <li>Once all the brigadeiros are coated and arranged on the plate, refrigerate them for about 30 minutes to set.</li>
            <li>Serve the brigadeiros chilled and enjoy!</li>
